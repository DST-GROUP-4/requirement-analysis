The next week we will have our first group presentation of requirement analysis.
For me, document developer, will upload initial *requirement analysis* and *presentation slides* before the meeting.
We will meet on this Sunday at 5 p.m. in library discussion room to talk about: 
1. modification of requirement analysis (each member responsible for each part shoulf offer their own opinions)
2. how to present our requirement analysis 
3. arrangement of presentation (which part belongs to which member)
